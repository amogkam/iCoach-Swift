##Description
iCoach is the iOS app that I developed as part of the Afterburner mentorship program. This app was the first large-scale project that I worked on. I often attended my brother's youth basketball games, and I realized that the coaches still use the traditional pen and paper to record stats. Therefore, I decided to make an app that will allow coaches to keep track of their players, games, and stats in a more efficient manner. This way, it is much easier to perform statistical analysis, and look at the player's stats not only on a per game basis, but also on a per season basis. The app also contains a unique feature that uses a linear weight algorithm to predict each player's Player Efficiency Rating for future games and provide lineup suggestions. To develop the app, I used the Model-View-Controller design. This way, the modeling of the information is separated from what is actually presented to the user. I also used many online resources such as Treehouse tutorials and Stack Overflow.
